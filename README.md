### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Khalil, I am a PhD student at the university of Leipzig in Germany at the [Remote Sensing Centre for Earth System Research (RSC4Earth)](https://rsc4earth.de/). I have a **MSc in Ecology** from the University of Bayreuth (Germany).

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on the social economic impacts of climate and weather extreme events within the [XAIDA](https://xaida.eu/) project.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m always learning many things at the same time, but currently I try to focus more on Machine Learning and Causal Inference.

If you are also working on this topic and think we could collaborate, don't hesiatet to get in touch !
